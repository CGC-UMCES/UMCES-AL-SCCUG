# UMCES AL Scientific Computing Cluster (SCC) User Group

## Introduction
The **UMCES AL SCC User Group (SCCUG)** is a community of researchers and students who use the **Scientific Computing Cluster (SCC)** at UMCES Appalachian Lab and are interested in sharing knowledge about computational methods and tools.  

Our focus is on improving the efficiency and reproducibility of computational research performed on the SCC. Topics of discussion include (but are not limited to):  
- Best practices for **file transfers** and data management  
- **Parallelizing code** for faster analysis  
- Efficient use of **memory and CPU resources**  
- Workflow automation and job scheduling  
- Tips for working with large datasets (e.g., remote sensing, genomics, modeling)  
- Software tools and libraries for scientific computing  

This repository provides a central space for:
- Sharing code examples, job submission templates, and tutorials  
- Documenting solutions to common problems  
- Exchanging strategies for optimizing workflows on the SCC  

By collaborating as a group, we aim to make scientific computing at UMCES more efficient, accessible, and sustainable.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues users encounter include:
- **Connection problems:** Verify VPN and SSH configuration as described in the [SCC User Manual](http://scc-manual.al.umces.edu).  
- **Insufficient resources:** Request more CPUs or memory for your VM by contacting the SCC administrators.  
- **File transfer errors:** Use reliable tools like `rsync` or `scp` to move data between your local machine and the SCC.  

If you encounter issues not covered here, please check the User Manual or open a discussion in the UMCES AL SCC User Group Google Chat group.
