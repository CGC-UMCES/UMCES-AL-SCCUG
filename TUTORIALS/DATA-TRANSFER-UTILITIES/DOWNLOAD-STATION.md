# Quick Tutorial: Using Download Station on SCC-SAN

## What is Download Station?
Download Station is a built-in application on the **SCC-SAN** device that lets you **automate downloading data directly into your SCC home directory**. It supports multiple formats and protocols, and uses a **dedicated high-speed research network (MDREN + Internet2)** for maximum transfer speeds.

## Why use it?
- Avoid slow downloads through your laptop/desktop  
- Pull data directly into SCC storage  
- Automate bulk or scheduled downloads
- Easy graphical user interface for setup and monitoring downloads
  
## Why avoid it?
- Cumbersome if not downloading large or numerous files
- Limited to 50 URLs per batch, reducing utility and efficiency when loading 100s of URLS
- Best suited for a relatively narrow set of use cases (e.g., tens to hundreds of files, or particularly large datasets)

## How to Access
1. Open a browser and go to:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://scc-san.al.umces.edu:5001](https://scc-san.al.umces.edu:5001)
2. Login using your **SCC credentials**.  

## Next Steps
- Once logged in, explore the **Download Station interface** to set up new downloads.  
- You can configure sources (e.g., FTP, HTTP, SFTP, torrents) and schedule downloads.  
- Files will appear in your **SCC home directory** once complete.
